# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
=======
ATS_Assignment: Chrome Extension
It is a **frontend-only Chrome Extension** built using **React + Vite**.  
It allows users to **instantly fetch the title and URL of the active browser tab** and **copy** them to clipboard.  
No backend, no server — everything runs directly in your browser!


## ✨ Features

- 🚀 Fetches **active tab’s title and URL**
- 📋 **Copy to clipboard** button for quick sharing
- 💻 Built entirely in **React (Vite)**
- 🧩 Uses **Chrome Extension Manifest V3**
- ⚡ Lightweight and responsive popup UI


## 🧠 How It Works
When you click **“Get Tab Info”**, the extension uses the Chrome Tabs API to fetch details of your active tab and displays them in the popup.

## Working flow
-open the chrome://extensions/ in the new tab 

-enables the developer mode

-then load unpacked and select the /dist folder from the project

-then the extension is successfully added on the chrome extension list

-pin the extension on the taskbar represented by an image

-when click on the image then it has a button of "Get tab info", click on that then it will give the name and url of the current tab open.
